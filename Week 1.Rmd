## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

 Markdown Notes
  bold = **word**
  italic - *word*
  # is header size, number of # = header
  in line link 
    [word](website)
  Reference link
    look at [a fun place]
    [a fun place]: website
  Inline/Reference Images
    add ! in front
    ![word](picture)
  Block Quote
    >in front of quote
    paragraphs need > in spaces as well
  Unordered List = Bullet point
    * word
    * word
  2 spaces aftera line is a soft break
  
R Basics
  assigning a variable x <- what you want x to be
  Vector = c(1, 2, 3)
  can assign vectors  to a variable
  up arrow will show previous commands
  type 2 letters and hit tab to see commands
Sequence of Numbers
  seq(0, 10, by=0.5)
  seq(0,10, length=30)
  length(something) shows length
Vector
  logical contains true, false, and NA
  ask if vector is <> any number you get T/F answers
  logical operators = == equality != inequality
     If we have two logical expressions, A and B, we can ask whether at least one is TRUE with A | B (logical'or' a.k.a. 'union') or whether they are both TRUE with A & B (logical 'and' a.k.a. 'intersection'). Lastly, !A is the negation of A and is TRUE when A is FALSE and vice versa
  CHaracter Vectors
    paste(my_char, collapse = " ")
    collapses a character vecctor
    make character vector by c("word", "word")
    example = paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " ")
  Missing Values
    NA = value not available
    NAN = not a number
    is.na(x) vector logical values same length as x with true = numbers
  Subsetting Vectors
    x is a vector
    x[1:10] shows first 10 of vector
    logical vectors
      all non-NA values from vector y <- x[!is.na(x)]
      y[y > 0] makes all positive integers of y appear
      x[!is.na(x) & x > 0] all values of x not missing and greater than 0
      x[c(-2, -10)] every integer except 2 and 10
      vect <- c(foo = 11, bar = 2, norf = NA) names integers
      can then find names of vect w/names(vect)
      identical( name, name) checks id identical things
      
    Matricies and Data Frames
      matrices can only contain a single class of data
      data frames can consis of many different classes of data
      dim(my_vector) <- c(4, 5) sets dim attribute to my vector dim=dimmension
        created a matrix of 4 rows 5 columns
      my_matrix2 <- matrix(1:20, nrow=4, ncol=5)
        creates same matrix as above
      cbind() combines columns combine character list of patients with matrix
      
      data.frame(patients, my_matrix) can store character vectors along side numbers
      colnames(my_data) <- cnames crete column names for data as saved in cnames character list
      
    Looking at Data
      common for data to be stored in data frame
        therefore has 2 dimensions, rows and columns
      nrow() checks rows ncol() checks colomns
      head(plants,10) shows first 10 rows of data
      tail(plants, 10) shows last 10 rows of data
      summary(data) gives details
      table(plants$Active_Growth_Period) gives table of column 
      str() is structure. give a lot of above data
